Entry 1: The speedrun to completion!

Oh crap, where has the 2u switch footprint been my entire life??

Alright, im trying to finish this in roughly under a day. for that reason  I'm gonna grind 9 hours on this.

I'll do entry 2 when I Complete the PCB and SCHEMATIC

Total time taken 0hrs

Entry time taken 0hrs

Entry 2: PCB and SCHEMATIC complete!!

I finally finished the schematic and pcb!! I had to redownload some bits and bobs, but totally worth it. it looks really sick!

Wiring was torture though, I spent alot of the time
looking on that. ON top of that. I saved and closed and added
meaurements to this when i just realised i messed up on the pcb.

I also had to add 3d models to each of the things, so that also took lots of time


all in all

Entry 3: The finale.

I finally finished the CAD. im pretty proud of it, i chose a black and which scheme mainly because thats what most 3d printer people in printing liegeon have
I had to reiterate on the pcb which took a hell lotta time. but thank god i finished it.
oh btw i forgot to mention, i did the cad like half way before i went to sleep.


So I basically got 9-10 hours under my belt. and the only reason why im journalling this is only cuz im getting stabs :heavysob:

I hope you liked it!
